# CurseScraper

This repo contains the scripts that scrape online curse word data sources. This scraped content is then saved to a Firebase Firestore database for personal use in training or other.

`noswearing_parser.py` takes all the curse words from [No Swearing](http://noswearing.com/dictionary/).
